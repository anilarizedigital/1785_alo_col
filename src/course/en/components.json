Especially where this involves co-operation between several teams, departments and/or different organisations to achieve an agreed objective.”<br/><br/>For successful collaboration we need to  develop working environments and demonstrate behaviours which enable us and others to perform at their best.<br/><br/>We need to be attentive of the wider working group and make sure we are all working towards a single purpose.<br/><br/>We need to ensure that we involve the right individuals at the right time and, regular negotiations should be in place to help the group reach mutual agreements.<br/><br/>Collaborative working does not always mean working in a team, we still need to make decisions, keep on top of our own tasks and ensure things happen. However, we also need to keep our minds open and proactively engage in collaboration.<br/><br/>Sometimes collaboration is perceived as a burden and difficult especially when trying to merge organisations and cultures.<br/><br/>Collaborative working does have its challenges such as:<br/><ul><li>Communication</li><li>Leadership Support</li><li>Traditional ways of working</li><li>Parochial attitudes</li><li>Approach to risk</li><li>Motivational and incentivisation</li><li>Knowledge, skills and abilities</li><li>Creating a collaborative culture</li><li>How to start, when to end</li><li>Extending trust</li><li>Articulating and evaluating success</li></ul><br/>If everyone strives for collaborative working then the benefits can far outweigh the challenges.<br/><br/>Effective collaboration happens when the stakeholders of a project or team can bring together structures, processes and skills to achieve integration to benefit, strategic, tactical, operational, interpersonal and cultural working practices.<br/><br/>But what does this mean for you and your organisation?<br/><br/>Working in this way allows for knowledge sharing and helps to create a culture of continuous improvement.<br/><br/>Duplication is reduced which results in better use of resources.<br/><br/>Collaboration can allow us to work in new ways, allowing for creativity and innovation to achieve our outcomes.<br/><br/>Collaborative working increases trust, satisfaction and performance both for individuals and the organisation as a whole."

Self-awareness is important in nurturing good relationships with colleagues and in the creation of positive and productive teamwork skills. Team members need to be aware of the potential impact of their unregulated emotions and their potential detriment to the broader team. Team members with emotional intelligence demonstrate confidence, originating from their own emotional self-awareness and self-regulation.",

            "<b>Motivation</b><br/><br/>Being able to motivate oneself is a very effective, emotionally intelligent characteristic. The ability to elicit discretionary effort in others through increased motivation is also a valuable tool in pursuance of task achievement. In order to feel motivated, team members need to feel valued, confident that they are led well and are enthusiastic about the mission. Motivation is a shared responsibility between the individual, team members and leaders.",

Empathic team members embrace difference and understand the role of diversity in nurturing productive human relationships and enhancing the team effectiveness through the multiplicity of thinking styles.",
            "<b>Social Skills</b><br/><br/>Team members have a shared responsibility to encourage cooperation, collaboration and teamwork through the skills of human interactivity such as rapport building dialogue, positive body language, empathic questioning and active listening. These skills allow for positive and trusting relationships which have the capacity to manage tensions via discussions, rather than arguments and focus team members around task achievement."

As a result, he does not pick up new skills effectively, finds tasks more difficult down the line and the result is he then misses out on being part of new projects and promotions.<br/><br/>On a different day when Ted is thinking with a more positive and growth focussed mindset he is open to opportunity and embraces the challenge.<br/><br/>Ted’s growth mindset enables him to develop skills, which opens opportunities for future new projects, a different job role and a promotion.<br/><br/>Through his achievements and successes, he can then apply a similar approach to other situations in his life where his mindset was previously fixed – to enable him to now achieve other positive outcomes.<br/><br/>Our mindset and outlooks can be contagious; they can affect our thought patterns and seep into how we approach everyday tasks and behaviours in a range of situations.<br/><br/>Recognising and managing our mindset and inner dialogue in collaborative situations can have a transformational and positive effect if we stay open, curious and keep a growth mindset."

            "<b>Competing</b><br/><br/>This is the “win-lose” approach. You act in a very assertive way to achieve your goals, without seeking to cooperate with the other party, and it may be at the expense of the other party. This approach may be appropriate for emergencies when time is of the essence, or when you need quick, decisive action, and people are aware of and support the approach.<br/><br/>Competing can mean “standing up for your rights,” defending a position which you believe is correct, or simply trying to win.",
            "<b>Collaborating</b><br/><br/>This is where you partner or pair up with the other party to achieve both of your goals. This is how you break free of the “win-lose” paradigm and seek the “win-win.” This can be effective for complex scenarios where you need to find a novel solution. Collaborating between two persons might take the form of exploring a disagreement to learn from each other’s insights or trying to find a creative solution to an interpersonal problem.<br/><br/>The balance that needs to be considered is that it requires a high-degree of trust and reaching a consensus can require a lot of time and effort to get everybody on board and to synthesize all the ideas.",
            "<b>Avoiding</b><br/><br/>This is when you simply avoid the issue. You are not helping the other party reach their goals, and you are not assertively pursuing your own. This works when the issue is trivial or when you have no chance of winning. It can also be effective when the issue would be very costly or when the atmosphere is emotionally charged and you need to create some space.<br/><br/>Avoiding may enable you to sidestep an issue diplomatically, postponing an issue until a better time, or simply withdrawing from a threatening situation.",
            "<b>Accommodating</b><br/><br/>This is when you cooperate to a high-degree, and it may be at your own expense, and actually work against your own goals, objectives, and desired outcomes.  This approach is effective when the other party is the expert or has a better solution. It can also be effective for preserving future relations with the other party. Accommodating might take the form of selfless generosity or charity, obeying another person’s order when you would prefer not to, or yielding to another’s point of view.",
            "<b>Compromising</b><br/><br/>This is the “lose-lose” scenario where neither party really achieves what they want. This requires a moderate level of assertiveness and cooperation.  It may be appropriate for scenarios where you need a temporary solution, or where both sides have equally important goals.<br/><br/>The trap is to fall into compromising as an easy way out, when collaborating would produce a better solution. However there could be some situations where compromising might be necessary to split the difference between the two positions, exchange concessions, or seek a quick middle-ground solution."
